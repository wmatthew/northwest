Credits
The underlying game was conceived by David Gale and Fred Schuh. It is
sometimes known as Chomp.

This uses jQuery (http://jquery.com/).

Quotes were attributed to Confucius online, and may well be things he
actually said.

Technical Requirements

Northwest requires JavaScript and HTML5 (for canvas). Most browsers
these days have those.

Northwest has been tested in recent (Jun 2012) versions of Chrome,
Firefox, IE, and Safari. It seems to work well in all of them, though
it's a little snappier in Chrome.
